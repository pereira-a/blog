Don't expect some fancy description of me, I am just another typical geek guy. Around 13 or 14 years old I started programming mainly because of video games which were my passion at the time. Bought some books about C and a new passion started, maybe even an obsession. The years passed, and I followed my studies in Lisbon, got a Bachelor's in Computer Software Engineering and also a Master's Degree with a minor in Systems Architecture and Computer Networks (2015 - 2020).

Today my focus is to architect beautiful distributed cloud-based ecosystems where applications, clients, and developers can all live together in harmony. Some of the topics that I'm interested in are:
- Distributed systems
- Microservices
- Event-Driven Architectures
- Containerization
- Kubernetes

I'm creating this blog to use it as a dump for "crumbs" of information, work, or investigation performed by me (therefore the name 'brain crumbs'). By doing so, I expect to have a where I can organize my thoughts and revisit to read some ideas or recipes used in the past.
